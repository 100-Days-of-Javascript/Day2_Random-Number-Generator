## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The sytle and structure of this project is pretty similar to the Day1 project. which can be found here: 
[Day1: CounterApp](https://github.com/100-Days-of-Javascript/Day1_CounterApp). Functions such as Math.random() or 
Math.floor() were used for obtaining the randomizer.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter how small the project is, it is always important to practice clean code and general Software Engineering principles.
